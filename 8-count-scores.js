/***********************************************************************
Write a function `countScores(people)` that takes in an array of score
objects (people) as its input. A score object has two key-value pairs:
a name (string) and a score (number). `countScores(people)` should
return an object that has key-value pairs where each name is a key and
the value is their total score.

Example 1

const ppl = [ 
    {name: "Pete", score: 10},
    {name: "Mike", score : 10},
    {name: "Pete", score: -8},
    {name: "Dexter", score: 12}
];

const countPpl = countScores(ppl);
countPpl; //=> { Pete: 2, Mike: 10, Dexter: 12 }

Example 2

const peeps = [
  {name: "Pete", score: 2},
  {name: "Dexter", score: 2},
  {name: "Mike", score: 2},
  {name: "Dexter", score: 2},
  {name: "Mike", score: 2},
  {name: "Pete", score: 2},
  {name: "Dexter", score: 2}
];
countScores(peeps); //=> { Pete: 4, Mike: 4, Dexter: 6 }

const peeps = [
  {name: "Pete", score: 2},
  {name: "Dexter", score: 2},
  {name: "Mike", score: 2},
  {name: "Dexter", score: 2},
  {name: "Mike", score: 2},
  {name: "Pete", score: 2},
  {name: "Dexter", score: 2}
];

function countScores(people) {
  // Creating new object that we can put names and scores into.
  let finalScores = {}

  //
 people.forEach(person => {
   let name = Object.values(person)[0]
   let score = Object.values(person)[1]


   if (name in finalScores) finalScores[name] += score

   else finalScores[name] = score
 })
 return finalScores
}

console.log(countScores(peeps));
